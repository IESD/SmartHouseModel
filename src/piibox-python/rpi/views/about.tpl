<p>This webpage is an indicative demonstration of the possible functionality of a smart home</p>

<p>It was originally developed for the British Science fair in Birmingham 10th1/11th September 2014.</p>

<p>Initially, lights, heating and water heating are controlled from a webpage.  The demonstrator can also run in "normal operation" mode, where it runs a normal day, or be driven from a simulation created using the <a href="www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~cascade">CASCADE</a> framework developed within the Institute for Energy and Sustainable Development (IESD) at De Montfort University</p>

<p>Over time, additional functionality will be added to both the demonstration model and this webpage</p>
